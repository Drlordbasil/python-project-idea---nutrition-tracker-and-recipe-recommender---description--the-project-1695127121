# Nutrition Tracker and Recipe Recommender

## Description
The Nutrition Tracker and Recipe Recommender is a Python program that acts as a virtual nutrition coach. It utilizes web scraping using Beautiful Soup and Google search capabilities to gather nutritional data from various online sources. The program provides personalized nutrition recommendations, tracks daily food intake, and suggests healthy recipes based on the user's dietary preferences and goals.

## Key Features
1. **Personalized Nutrition Recommendations**: The program analyzes the user's dietary requirements and goals, such as weight management and energy levels. It provides personalized recommendations on daily calorie intake, macronutrient distribution, and micronutrient requirements.

2. **Food Intake Tracking**: The program allows the user to track their daily food intake. They can either search for specific food items or select options from a pre-defined database. The program calculates the nutritional values, including calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates, etc., and displays the user's progress towards their daily goals.

3. **Recipe Recommender**: The program uses web scraping techniques with Beautiful Soup to extract recipes from popular recipe websites. It then filters these recipes based on the user's preferences and dietary restrictions. The program suggests healthy and delicious recipes for each mealtime, taking into account the user's calorie and nutrient requirements.

4. **Nutritional Analysis**: The program can analyze the nutritional content of the recommended recipes. It provides information about the macronutrient and micronutrient composition of each dish. Additionally, it highlights any potential allergens or dietary restrictions in the ingredients.

5. **Weekly Progress Insights**: The program tracks the user's dietary progress over time. It generates visualizations and reports that highlight their calorie intake, macronutrient distribution, and overall nutritional balance. This data-driven insight helps the user make informed decisions about their eating habits.

6. **Personalized Notifications and Reminders**: The program sends personalized notifications and reminders to the user. These notifications can help the user stay on track with their nutrition goals. Examples include reminders to log their meals, notifications about reaching specific milestones, or alerts about potential nutrient deficiencies.

7. **Integration with Wearables and Fitness Trackers**: The program can integrate with popular wearables and fitness trackers. This integration allows the program to gather additional data about the user's physical activity, sleep patterns, and calorie burn. This data is then used to provide more accurate nutrition and wellness recommendations.

## How to Use
1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

2. Import the required libraries:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import datetime
```

3. Define the `VirtualNutritionCoach` class, which acts as the main controller for the program. This class has various methods to set goals, track food intake, recommend recipes, analyze nutrition, generate reports, send notifications, and integrate with wearables.

4. The program utilizes web scraping techniques to gather nutrition information and recipe data. The `BeautifulSoup` library is used to parse HTML and extract data from websites.

5. Define a series of methods within the `VirtualNutritionCoach` class to perform specific tasks, such as tracking food intake, searching for food items, recommending recipes, analyzing recipe nutrition, generating progress reports, sending notifications, and integrating with wearables.

6. The main logic of the program is encapsulated in the `run` method. This method handles user interaction and displays a menu to perform different actions using the program.

7. Customize the program as per the user's requirements. For example, the `set_personalized_recommendations` method can be modified to set the user's personalized goals and preferences.

8. Run the program by executing the following code:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
    nutrition_coach = VirtualNutritionCoach(user_name)
    nutrition_coach.run()
```
The user will be prompted to enter their name, and the virtual nutrition coach will start.
